    <h2>Improving Website Archivability</h2>
    <h6><em>Abigail Walker</em></h6>
    <br>
    <p>The way a site is constructed and updated can greatly affect its chances of being successfully and fully captured by an archival web crawler. As a part of your web archiving efforts, consider reaching out to those whose sites you’re saving, and to the greater artistic community. Once you’ve made those connections, you can help share knowledge about web archiving, archivability, and promote the use of tools and standards detailed below. You can also avoid future copyright issues and uncertainties by preemptively discussing your web archiving with potential stakeholders.</p>
    <p>NYU’s <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/march/nyu-libraries-to-team-with-internet-archive-to-preserve-high-quality-musical-content-on-the-web.html" target="_blank">Archiving the Websites of Contemporary Composers</a> project is a great example of web archiving outreach.
      The librarians and archivists involved are contacting those running and contributing to the composers' websites to ensure that all content on the websites can be archived, if they want it to be.
      Specifically, they are working with the composers or those managing the composers' estates to gain access to more high quality audio files, and to secure the rights to store and share those files.
      A similar outreach initiative for artist websites could lead to access to higher quality image or video files normally deemed too large to put on the web.</p>
      <p>Not only can getting in touch with artists and galleries help you with your archiving process, it can also help spread the word about your collection. You can also follow the advice below to better build your own personal or institutional website.</p>
      <hr class="pink">
      <h5>Consider your audience - today and tomorrow</h5>
      <p>As <a href="http://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2017/09/20/accessibility-and-archivability/" target="_blank">Ashley Blewer</a> and others have stated many times, <strong>archivability</strong> and <strong>accessibility</strong> go hand-in-hand.
        If a website is friendly for assistive technology like screen readers, then it will likely be friendly for crawlers.
        Basic ways you can make your site more accessible and archivable include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using alt text and transcriptions/captioning for images and other media</li>
          <li>Building a clear and consistent structure throughout your website</li>
          <li>Ensuring your site can be navigated using a keyboard</li>
        </ul>
          <p>Read more about web accessibility best practices in these <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility" target="_blank">W3</a> and <a href="https://webaim.org/articles/" target="_blank">WebAim</a> guides.</p>
          <p>Using <strong>responsive design</strong> is another way to improve current and future users’ experiences.
            If you are serving <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november13/kelly/11kelly.html" target="_blank">different or personalized content</a> to mobile users, this may cause crawlers to capture only one of several possible versions of the site.
          Make sure content on your website is readable and consistent so that everyone can experience the site regardless of browser size.</p>
          <p>Encouraging the artistic community to create accessible, responsive sites will help to better serve and reach new audiences today, and will help ensure that critical content can be saved for the researchers of tomorrow.</p>
          <hr class="pink">
          <h5>Think like a crawler</h5>
          <p>If a crawler can’t find pages on your website, it can’t capture them.
            Consider including a <strong>site map</strong>, either human-readable or in <a href="https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/" target="_blank">XML</a>, where all URLs are listed to ensure that they will all be included in an archived version.
            If your site includes a search function for navigating a group of files, try to include <strong>browsable categories</strong> as well.
            Again, this will help crawlers find and capture all of the searchable content, and will help current users navigate it as well.</p>
            <p>In addition to having listed or categorized resources on your site, the <strong>links</strong> themselves must be <strong>stable and findable</strong>.
            Avoid dynamically rendered or embedded links - try instead to include them in your HTML or CSS where they can be easily read by bots, and provide redirects should web addresses change.</p>
            <p>And of course, discourage the use of <strong>robots.txt</strong> exclusions that block archival crawler access to files such as stylesheets and images. <strong>Do use them</strong> to direct crawlers away from crawler traps like calendars, and to direct crawlers towards site maps.</p>
            <hr class="pink">
            <h5>See your website as an artifact</h5>
            <p>Spreading knowledge about the ongoing practice of web archiving helps people view their websites as someday being artifacts of historical value to researchers.
            The most valuable resources will be those whose <strong>structure</strong> has endured, those with <strong>context</strong>, and those that are <strong>open</strong> to crawling, copying, and reuse.</p>
            <p>Use <strong>open, durable standards and formats</strong> whenever possible, or if you must, long-standing proprietary formats such as PDFs.
            If a company decides to no longer support certain products and you have used them to create your website, it may become extremely difficult to capture and render your site correctly, as the software you used will be needed.</p>
            <p>Also be sure to correctly identify the <strong>character set encoding</strong> and media types so that captured versions of your site will render properly, and in general, validate your code.</p>
            <p>Correctly using <strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp" target="_blank">semantic HTML tags</a></strong> will, again, make your site more accessible, and more easily understood by bots.
            Examples include using the header tags to denote headings rather than adjusting the font size to make them appear larger, and using list tags to denote lists rather than using them as convenient ways to tab content.
            Another way to add context to your content is to include the <strong>dates of publication and updates</strong>. Technical metadata generated by a crawl will tell viewers the date of crawl, but not the date the content was created.</p>
            <p>We can’t know how the browsers of the future will look and function.
            There are no guarantees that our current web standards and best practices will last, but following them and not relying on specific browsers to render your site correctly is the best way to try to ensure future website readability.
            Meaningful metadata will further add information that will aid researchers in piecing together what you were creating and when, should certain aspects of your site not render in the future.</p>
            <p>Finally, encourage the use of <strong><a href="https://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a></strong> or other open licenses to signal to archivists that you grant permission to copy and replay your site for preservation purposes.
            This can significantly streamline the archiving process for institutions that require permission before crawling.</p>
