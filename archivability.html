    <h2>Improving Website Archivability</h2>
    <p>The way a site is constructed and updated can greatly affect its chances of being successfully and fully captured by an archival web crawler. As a part of your web archiving efforts, consider reaching out to those whose sites you’re saving, and to the greater artistic community. Once you’ve made those connections, you can help share knowledge about web archiving, archivability, and promote use of tools and standards detailed below. You can also avoid future copyright issues and uncertainties by preemptively discussing your web archiving with potential stakeholders.</p>
    <p>NYU’s <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/march/nyu-libraries-to-team-with-internet-archive-to-preserve-high-quality-musical-content-on-the-web.html" target="_blank">Archiving the Websites of Contemporary Composers</a> project is a great example of web archiving outreach.
      The librarians and archivists involved are contacting those running and contributing to the composer’s websites to ensure the all content on the websites can be archived, if they want it to be.
      Specifically, they are working with the composers or those managing the composer’s estates to gain access to more high quality audio files, and to secure the rights to store and share those files.
      A similar outreach initiative could lead to access to higher quality image or video files normally deemed too large to put on the web.</p>
      <p>Not only can getting in touch with artists and galleries help you with your archiving process, it can also help spread the word about your collection. You can also follow the advice below to better build your own personal or institutional website.</p>
