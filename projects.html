              <p>The Art Libraries Society of North America <a href="http://artistfiles.arlisna.org/" target="blank">Artist Files Special Interest Group (SIG)</a> began a web archiving project in 2012 to preserve the born-digital items normally collected by art libraries in artist files.  Although the program is no longer active, the collections are still accessible.</p>

              <p>The Artist Files SIG partnered with Archive-It, the web archiving service offered by the Internet Archive, to collect a specific group of web pages. Archive-It was especially interested in the Artist Files SIG project because it required their crawlers to capture different types of files. Archive-It donated server space and a data budget to the group which created two collections: <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/3538" target="_blank">Contemporary Art Galleries</a> and <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/5037" target="blank">Contemporary Art Galleries 2</a>.</p>

              <p>These two collections contain a wide range of sites including regional gallery websites, university web pages, and institutional and private blogs. As a result, the Archive-It crawlers captured:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Exhibition checklists and installation images</li>
                <li>Press releases and exhibition reviews</li>
                <li>Artist biographies and interviews</li>
                <li>Gallery publications</li>
                <li>Event announcements</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The collections also includes some complex web elements like embedded video, image carousels, and interactive tours.</p>

              <p>Metadata was assigned at the document, or web page, level and includes Library of Congress subject headings, in addition to gallery and artist names, in order to make the collections easy to search.</p>

The Venice Biennale is an international art exhibition, held in Venice, Italy every two years, where invited artists show work alongside installations from different countries. Many collateral art events also take place in the city while the exhibition is open. The Biennale’s unique and temporary nature make it the perfect subject for web archiving.</a></p>

            <p>Every Biennale year the Clark Art Institute Library creates a <a href="https://archive-it.org/organizations/711" target="_blank">new collection</a> and begins archiving sites when the international exhibition opens in the spring. They stop archiving in November when the Biennale closes. Documents captured include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Blogs</li>
              <li>Artist videos</li>

              <li>Websites for collateral events</li>
              <li>Social Media</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In 2013, the first year of the web archiving project, 99 sites were preserved. In 2015 there were 206 sites captured and in 2017 the Clark Art Institute Library collected 175 sites.</p>
