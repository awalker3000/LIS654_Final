              <p>The Art Libraries Society of North America Artist Files Special Interest Group (SIG) began a web archiving project in 2012 to preserve the born digital items normally collected by art libraries in artist files.  Although no longer active, the collections are still accessible.</p>

              <p>The Artist Files SIG partnered with the Archive-It web archiving service, offered by the Internet Archive, to crawl the live web and collect specific web pages using URLs pre-determined by members of the group. Archive-It was especially interested in the Artist Files SIG’s project because it would require their crawlers to capture different types of files and so donated server space and a data budget to the group. The Artist Files SIG created two collections: <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/3538" target="blank">Contemporary Art Galleries<a/> and <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/5037" target="blank">Contemporary Art Galleries 2</a>.</p>

              <p>These two collections contain a wide scope of pages including regional gallery websites, university web pages, and institutional and private blogs to capture born digital:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Exhibition checklists and installation images</li>
                <li>Press releases and exhibition reviews</li>
                <li>Artist biographies and interviews</li>
                <li>Gallery publications</li>
                <li>Event announcements</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The collections also include the capture of more complex web elements like embedded video, image carousels, and interactive tours.</p>

              <p>Every web capture was assigned metadata including gallery and artist names as well as Library of Congress subject headings to make the collections easy to search.</p>

              <p>The NMWA’s web archiving program began in 2011 and captures over 100 websites in three categories. It archives the NMWA institutional websites and social media which includes their blog, Flickr, Facebook, Twitter, and the Clara Database of Women Artists. The program also collect the websites of contemporary women artists, artist profiles on art gallery sites, and women-run artist organizations.

Together, they run an ambitious web archiving program to collect, preserve, and provide access to ten curated collections of websites that compliment each library’s print holdings and the archived websites of their parent institutions.</p>

              <p>The <a href="https://archive-it.org/organizations/484" target="blank">NYARC web resources program</a> collects 3,933 websites in the following ten categories:</p>

                <li>Artists’ Websites</li>

              <p>NYARC has been web archiving since 2010 but began to collect most of their assets in 2014. They are committed to documenting its web archiving practices and maintains a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nyarc3/web-archiving" target=blank>wiki</a> on the subject.</p>

            <p>Since 2013, the <a href="https://archive-it.org/organizations/711" target="blank">Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute Library</a> has used the Archive-It web archiving service, provided by the Internet Archive, to capture web pages associated with the Venice Biennale.  The Venice Biennale is an international art exhibition, held in Venice every two years, where invited artists show work alongside installations from different countries, while collateral events take place in the rest of the city. The Biennale’s unique and temporary nature make it the perfect subject for web archiving.</p>

            <p>Every Biennale year the The Clark Art Institute’s Library begins archiving when the international exhibition opens, in April or May and ends in November when the Biennale closes and captures:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Blogs</li>
              <li>Artist video</li>
              <li>Participant websites</li>
              <li>Official Biennale websites</li>
              <li>Websites for collateral events</li>
              <li>Social Media</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In 2013, 99 sites were preserved, in 2015 there were 206 captures and in 2017 the Clark Art Institute Library collected 175 assets.</p>
