        <p>We all understand the need to preserve and archive important paper documents, but we may not realize it is equally important to preserve and archive digital documents, especially those on the web. Websites change, move, and disappear entirely, making important content inaccessible and previously used content unverifiable.</p>

          <p>Web archiving is the process of making copies of these endangered websites from the live web and recording some basic information about the capture, like the date, the entity that made the copy, and if there are any other versions of the archived page. This allows the website to be stored, preserved, and accessed in the future.</p>

        <p>Increasingly, art librarians are tasked with preserving born-digital and digitized art history resources such as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Museum and Gallery websites</li>

          <li>Contemporary Artist websites</li>

          <li>Web-based exhibition catalogues, auction catalogues, and <em>catalogues raisonné</em></li>

          <li>Institutional records of exhibitions, symposia, workshops, and other events</li>

          <li>Online art history resources used and cited by scholars</li>

          <li>Correspondence between artists, scholars, and patrons that exist online or over social media</li>

          <li>Any other online resource in danger of moving or disappearing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Archiving these materials will make is possible for future researchers to access important information about the art world today, even if the original assets disappear from the live web.  A broken link will not render the resources unusable.</p>

        <p>In the last decade, materials of art historical value that were once available in printed form, are now often produced digitally and available on the web. Web archiving allows institutions to continue acquiring these assets and maintain their collection development policies without interruption.</p>

        <p>Think of contemporary art gallery websites for instance.  These galleries do not normally produce catalogues for each exhibition they mount. Instead, they feature the work currently on view on their website, including images and object information. Galleries usually include work from past exhibitions and artist profiles on their websites as well. Organizations like the <a href="projects.html#nyarc">New York Art Resources Consortium</a> have realized that it is vital to preserve and make accessible gallery websites and currently archive 171 New York City Galleries, including the now closed OK Harris Gallery. This site, and others, will provide future art historians with an essential source of information about today’s art world, and the contemporary art scene of the recent past, that does not exist in any other form.</p>

        <p>Web archiving will also allow institutions to capture and preserve temporary sites created for one-off or infrequent events.  The Venice Biennale, an international art fair that takes place every two years, is a perfect example of this. Every biennale year temporary pavilions are set up in Venice to house hundreds of exhibiting artist and country installations. The Biennale lasts almost 7 months and attracts many other ancillary art events.  In 2013, the <a href="projects.html#clark">Sterling and Francine Art Institute Library</a> recognized the need to preserve the numerous temporary websites that were built to accompany the art fair, and began a web archiving program to make these sites accessible to researchers in the near and distant future.</p>

        <p>Looking forward, the preservation and accessibility of art historical resources on the web could also enable the integration of new technologies in art historical research. In their paper <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/685975" target="blank">"The Future of Artist Files: Here Today, Gone Tomorrow"</a>, Samantha Deutch and Sally McKay discuss how the use of image recognition software used on archived artist files might lead to the identification of orphaned works or the discovery of paintings thought lost or destroyed after World War II.</p>
