        <p>We all understand the need to preserve and archive important paper documents, but we may not realize it is equally important to preserve and archive digital documents, especially those on the web. Websites change, move, and disappear entirely, making important content inaccessible and previously used content unverifiable.</p>

          <p>Web archiving is the process of making copies of online resources in danger of moving or disappearing from the live web and recording some basic information about the capture, such as the date, the entity that made the copy, and if there are other versions of the archived page. This allows the website to be stored, preserved, and accessed in the future. Web archiving prevents a broken link from rendering a resource unusable.</p>

        <p>Increasingly, art librarians are tasked with preserving born-digital and digitized art history resources such as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Museum and Gallery websites</li>

          <li>Contemporary Artist websites</li>

          <li>Web-based exhibition catalogues, auction catalogues, and <em>catalogues raisonné</em></li>

          <li>Institutional records of exhibitions, symposia, workshops, and other events</li>

          <li>Online art history resources used and cited by scholars</li>

          <li>Correspondence between artists, scholars, and patrons on social media</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Archiving these materials will make is possible for future researchers to access meaningful information about the art world today, even if the original documents disappear from the live web.</p>

        <p>Think of contemporary art gallery websites, for instance.  These galleries do not normally produce catalogues for each exhibition they mount. Instead, they feature work currently on view on their website. This includes images and object information. Galleries usually include work from past exhibitions and artist profiles on their websites as well. Realizing that it is vital to preserve and make these sites accessible, the <a href="projects.html">New York Art Resources Consortium</a> (NYARC) currently archives the websites of 171 New York City Galleries, including the now closed OK Harris Gallery. This site, and others, will provide future art historians with an essential source of information about today’s art world, and the contemporary art scene of the recent past, that does not exist in any other form.</p>

        <p>Web archiving will also allow institutions to capture and preserve temporary sites created for unique or infrequent events. The Venice Biennale, an international art fair that takes place every two years, is a perfect example of such an event. Every biennale year temporary pavilions are set up in Venice to house hundreds of exhibiting artist and country installations. The Biennale lasts almost seven months and attracts many other ancillary art events. In 2013, the <a href="projects.html">Sterling and Francine Art Institute Library</a> recognized the need to preserve the numerous temporary websites that were built to accompany the art fair, and began a web archiving program to make these sites accessible to researchers in the near and distant future.</p>

        <p>This collection of archived websites complements the Clark's historical collection of print materials produced for the biennale. In fact, in the last decade, materials of art historical value that were once available in printed form, are now often produced digitally and available on the web. Web archiving allows institutions to continue acquiring these assets and maintain their collection development policies without interruption.</p>

        <p>Looking forward, the preservation and accessibility of digital art resources on the web could also enable the integration of new technologies in art historical research. In their paper <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/685975" target="blank">"The Future of Artist Files: Here Today, Gone Tomorrow"</a>, Samantha Deutch and Sally McKay discuss how image recognition software could potentially be used with archived artist files to identify orphaned works or discover paintings thought lost or destroyed after World War II.</p>
