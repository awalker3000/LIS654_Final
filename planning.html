        <p>Before making decisions about the specific technologies to use in a web archiving program, it is important to understand the <a href="process.html">basic process</a> of web archiving and to plan out the project. The steps below can help an organization thoughtfully develop a web archiving program. They are divided into two sections: broad institutional considerations that will set the course of the program and daily activities that represent the ongoing work of the program. These steps are based on the <a href="http://ait.blog.archive.org/files/2014/04/archiveit_life_cycle_model.pdf" target="blank">Web Archiving Life Cycle Model</a> developed by Archive-It, but are practical considerations for any group wanting to initiate a web archiving program, whether or not they choose to use the Archive-It service.</p>

        <h4>Determine the Purpose and Goals of the Project</h4>
        <p>In the earliest planning stages, organizations will need to outline their goals for the web archiving program and understand how it aligns with the broader mission of the institution. For organizations seeking to preserve art historical resources, web archiving can combat link rot and save assets at risk from disappearing from the web. It can also help libraries collect born-digital publications.</p>
        <p>Many of the institutions profiled in the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page view web archiving as an extension of their collection development policy. Some places may also be required to archive institutional websites and born-digital publications in the same way they archive traditional outreach materials. Increasingly, organizations are also choosing to capture their social media sites.</p>

        <h4>Examine Your Resources</h4>
        <p>The institutional funding and staff available to contribue to a web archiving program will determine the scope of the project. It can be helpful to ask the following questions:</p>
        <div class="container">
        <ul>
          <li>Do we already have institutional support for a web archiving program or will we need to advocate for its creation?</li>

          <li>Do we have a budget line that can be leveraged for the program or will we need to find funding elsewhere?</li>

          <li>Do we have in-house experts who can set up crawlers and partition server space or will we need to find a tool, like Archive-It, that staff can use without in-depth technical knowledge?</li>

          <li>Which type of staff will be involved in the web archiving program: archivists, librarians, digital projects staff, information technology staff? Will students contribute to the program?</li>

          <li>Which staff members will curate our collections? Will they also be responsible for quality control?</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Decide Who Will Have Access & How is it Granted</h4>
        <p>Many institutions want to provide open access to their archived collections, but some collections may need to be private for a time. Other institutions may want to restrict use of the web archives to certain IP addresses.</p>

        <p>If a collection is accessible, an organization will need to determine how how they will provide access to the public and how they will promote the archived materials. The technology and interface used to do this will need to be researched. Archive-It users are able to view archived sites through the <a href="http://archive.org/web/" target="blank">Wayback Machine</a>. For more information on other playback tools, see the <a href="tools.html#playback">Experiments with Archiving Tools</a> page.</p>

        <p>Some users of Archive-It build branded web pages to introduce their web archiving program and link to the Archive-It page.</p>

        <h4>Adopt a Preservation Policy</h4>
        <p>In order to best preserve the collections captured by their web archiving program, institutions should ask themselves the following questions:</p>
        <div class="container">
        <ul>
          <li>How will we store and preserve our WARC files and related metadata? </li>

          <li>Will we store data in our own repository or will we let a service like Archive-It handle storage?</li>

          <li>Will we have multiple copies of our data in multiple locations for redundancy?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p></p>

      <div class="col-md-8">
        <h4>Manage Risk</h4>
        <p>Institutions will need to determine how they will manage any potential risks related to copyright. Some organizations choose to seek written permission from every website owner before they begin capture while others chose to take advantage of “fair use,” the right granted to libraries and archives to use copyrighted materials for purposes such as teaching and research. Each web archiving program should also determine whether they will respect <a href="process.html#robots">robots.txt</a> or whether they will sometimes ignore this script in order to fully capture a site.</p>
        <p>In cases where permission is not obtained before collection, having a clearly stated removal policy is also important.</p>

        <h4>Curation - <em>What is being collected?</em></h4>
        <p>At most institutions, only a handful of staff will choose which websites to include in each collection. Specific seeds, or URLs, will tell crawlers what to capture. The purpose and goals of the web archiving program will help to determine what is collected. Some organizations only capture their own web pages and social media, while others also collect assets that complement their print collections.</p>
        <p>It is important to be aware of and collaborate with other <a href="projects.html">institutions</a> in order to conserve resources and avoid duplicating collections.</p>

      <h4>Scope - <em>How much is being collected?</em></h4>
      <p>Once you know the sites you want to collect, you need to determine the scope of your capture. The crawler will need to be told how much of any website to collect. Do you want to harvest an entire website, a portion of the site, or just one webpage? Will your crawler also capture the external pages linked on the website? The scope can be delineated prior to harvest and is often tweaked after a first capture is done.</p>

      <p>Resources like staff time and budget will most likely determine scope. The number of documents captured is directly related to the amount of staff time required to perform quality control as well as the amount of dedicated server or cloud space needed for data storage.</p>

      <h4>Data Capture - <em>How often does collection take place?</em></h4>
      <p>Once you know exactly what you want to capture, you need to decide how often to collect your sites by setting the frequency of your crawlers. You will also determine how much of your selected webpages are feasible to collect by setting the duration of the crawl and choosing which file types to capture.</p>

      <p>Data capture will be determined by the documents you wish to collect and how often they are updated on the live web.  Your institutional resources, and the limits thereof, will also determine the amount of data you are able to save.</p>

      <h4>Metadata - <em>How do we describe what we collect?</em></h4>
      <p>Once you have captured your data, you will need to make decisions about metadata.  The following questions can help:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>At what level will you create metadata: the collection level, the seed (starting url) level, or the document (webpage) level?</li>
        <li>Will you create metadata manually or scrape it from the site being archived?</li>
        <li>Will any of this metadata be included in the institution’s library catalog system?</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="col-md-8">
      <h4>Storage - <em>How do we store what we collect?</em></h4>
      <p>A plan should be established which takes into account the long-term storage needs of your archived data. You should decide whether the web archive will be stored in an institutional repository or at a third party site. You should also determine whether copies of your data will be made and stored in multiple locations.</p>

      <p>Your storage plan will likely be a direct result of the your institution’s preservation policy.</p>

      <h4>Quality Control - <em>Did we collect what we intended?</em></h4>
      <p>After a capture has been made, staff members will need to engage in quality control in order to assess the completeness of the capture. Some crawlers produce reports which can be reviewed and staff should also click through the archived webpages manually in order to evaluate the success of the capture. Web archiving is often an iterative process, especially when a capture is first made, so it is important for staff members to monitor the results.</p>
